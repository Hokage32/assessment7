The extraLargeArray is ran in both doublerAppend and doublerInsert, but doublerInsert takes significantly longer than doublerAppend because of the .unshift method. The .unshift method will try to put the selected value at the front of the array while pushing all of the other values in the array back 1 (hence the term shift).

As the array becomes smaller, the roles change. doublerAppend becomes slower than doublerInsert because it takes less time to shift down.
